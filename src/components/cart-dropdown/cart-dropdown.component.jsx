    //! Why not call useNavigate() directly here?
    //! Because of React Hooks Rule #1:
    //! Hooks must be called at the top level of a component, not inside nested functions or conditionals.
    //! That's why we call useNavigate() once at the top of the component,
    //! and then use the navigate function inside this handler when needed.

    //! Also, why not just use a <Link> tag?
    //! If you only need simple internal navigation, use a <Link to="..."> â€” it's clean and declarative.
    //! But if you need to perform logic or side effects (e.g., check cart, track event) before navigating,
    //! then define a function like this and use navigate() programmatically.
